  </h1>



  <h2>
    <mark> Your music taste is fun. It's varied but also very you.</mark></a>
  </h2>

  <h2>
    <mark> It's like the perfect blend of everything, and I love how we can talk about it. </mark></a>
  </h2>

  <h2>
    <mark> That one time we like played the "guess-what-year-this-song-came-out" <br> and you BRUTALLY lost (sorry) 
      is one of my favorite memories with you. 
    </mark>
  </h2>

  <h2>
    <mark> Sometimes when i'm out buying groceries or whatever and I hear some song playing, <br>
      I wish you were there with me hearing it together.</mark>
  </h2>

  <h2>
    <mark> I love how you appreciate music of all kinds. <br>
      Like you listen to everything truly, and you tolerate my music too. </mark>
